# SMG Only Maya


## Intro

This is a written guide of JoltzDude139 playthrough of Borderlands 2 as SMG only Maya. I will mainly be summarizing based off of the youtube videos published on his chanel. See the [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhTB4jmaHPMHXAmFoTEyJcsZqfeuoLCVy). Joltz plan for the playthrough is to only use SMGs and complete the game, as well as collect all unique SMGs in the game.

I highly reccomend watching the videos/streams yourself, there is plenty of great BL2 information he shares that I am not recording here.

## Pre-Requisites

The playthough uses a number of DLCs for various reasons. If you do not own all the major game DLC you may experience difficulties following each step. At this time I do not plan to write in non DLC alternate options.

## Disclaimers

I am technically writing this without Joltz permission, but by no means is it meant to take away from his content. I merely wanted to make a writen guide that was a bit easier to follow along with while doing the SMG only playthough myself.



## Normal Mode

- Start a new game and make your fresh siren.

**NOTE** If you don't have the Gearbox starting weapons you may not have an SMG until a few steps later, that is alright you don't have to kill anything for a bit

- Grab the starting pistol to progress the quest, but of course don't use it. Once you have access to the fast travel in Claptraps hideout, travel over to ***The Raid on Digistruct Peak***
  - Grab the quest
